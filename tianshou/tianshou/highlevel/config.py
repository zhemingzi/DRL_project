    the number of epochs to run training for. An epoch is the outermost iteration level and each

        buffer (see :attr:`step_per_collect`)
      * performs one or more gradient updates (see :attr:`update_per_step`),

    and the test step collects :attr:`num_episodes_per_test` test episodes in order to evaluate
    agent performance.

    The number of training steps in each epoch is indirectly determined by
    :attr:`step_per_epoch`: As many training steps will be performed as are required in
    order to reach :attr:`step_per_epoch` total steps in the training environments.

    :attr:`step_per_collect`) and :attr:`step_per_epoch` is set to `s`, then the number
    of training steps per epoch is `ceil(s / c)`.
