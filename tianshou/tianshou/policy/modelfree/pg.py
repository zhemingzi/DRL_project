        If `self.action_type == "continuous"`: (`s_B` -> `dist_input_BD`).
    :param optim: optimizer for actor network.
    :param dist_fn: distribution class for computing the action.
        Maps model_output -> distribution. Typically a Gaussian distribution
        taking `model_output=mean,std` as input for continuous action spaces,
        or a categorical distribution taking `model_output=logits`
        for discrete action spaces. Note that as user, you are responsible
        for ensuring that the distribution is compatible with the action space.
    :param action_space: env's action space.
    :param discount_factor: in [0, 1].
    :param reward_normalization: if True, will normalize the *returns*
        by subtracting the running mean and dividing by the running standard deviation.
        Can be detrimental to performance! See TODO in process_fn.
    :param deterministic_eval: if True, will use deterministic action (the dist's mode)
        instead of stochastic one during evaluation. Does not affect training.
    :param observation_space: Env's observation space.
    :param action_scaling: if True, scale the action from [-1, 1] to the range
        of action_space. Only used if the action_space is continuous.
    :param action_bound_method: method to bound action to range [-1, 1].
        Only used if the action_space is continuous.
    :param lr_scheduler: if not None, will be called in `policy.update()`.
